# Miscellaneous

This section has no discernible theme, other than "things that might be useful to know":

1.  There will be some (but not many) "official" photographs at the church and at the reception.  We will want you to be in them, so please don't disappear.
We will aim to have these done as quickly as possible, which should allow time for exploring and looking around.

2.  We intend to provide some drinks, but there will also be a paying bar on site at the reception (to cater for Rob).  There will also be tea and coffee (to cater for Caroline).
It's worth noting that the bar only accepts cash payments.   There's cash points near the venue - the closest is in the nearby bus station which is less than 5 minutes walk (unless you are in heels, in which case all bets are off.) 

3.  For those who aren't familiar with Wakefield, here are the numbers of some local taxi firms:
  
      Wakefield Cars: (01924) 380000

      ABC:            (01924) 361111
      
      Ace Taxis:      (01924) 299999
