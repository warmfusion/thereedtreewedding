For those of you bringing cars to some or all of the day, here is some information about parking.
At St. Helen's, the car park is accessed through the LandRover garage next door to the church.  Drive through the forecourt, and throug hthe metal gate.  Parking is on your right.
The car park remains open during opening hours, 9-5pm Monday to Saturday and 10-4pm on Sunday. 
The church can be accessed through a gate leading into the churchyard (there should be someone at that gate on the day to meet you and take you through to the church.)

At QEGS, once you have entered the gate from the main road, follow the road down and to the right.  There is a large open space for parking.
There should be signs on the day itself to make this clearer.
QEGS have advised that vehicles can be left overnight, but they do not take responsibility for any vehicles on their property.
