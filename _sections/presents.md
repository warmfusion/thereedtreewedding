# Wedding Presents

We’re delighted that you’re coming to help us celebrate our wedding.  Please don’t feel that you need to bring presents.

However, if you would like to spend some money, we’re particularly interested in supporting this charity because we like what they do: [acts435](http://acts435.org.uk/)

We have a lot, and would like to share the wealth with those who don’t.

Failing that, a bottle of wine never goes amiss…
