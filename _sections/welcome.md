# The ReedTree Wedding

![The Couple](public/img/welcome.jpg)

We are Rob and Caroline.  If you're invited to our wedding, you should already know who we are.  We met in 2005, started living together in 2007, and in 2009 realised that we really quite liked each other and started going out.

During that time, we've realised that we really like cooking together (tapas and curry are particular favourites), watching TV, singing in the kitchen and filling the house full of friends, family and food (and wine).

Rob proposed in 2015 (much to Caroline's surprise) and now we're getting married.  A less romantic friend said recently "you've been living as married for years, and now this is a day to get the admin done".  Sweet.

We're really pleased that we're getting married, and we're planning a great day. We really hope that you're able to come and join us, and we made this site so that there would be a place that you could find all the information that you need.
